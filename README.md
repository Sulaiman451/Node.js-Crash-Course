# Overview
This repo covers my first time exploring the back end, through Net Ninja's Node.js crash course (from 2020). 

This covers the basics including:
 - The global object 
 - Modules & require
 - Node & the file system (creating, reading,   deleting, etc.)
 - Streams & buffers

Also covered is:
 - How to create a server using Node to create a site
 - How to create an Express app/website
 - How to use MongoDB
 - How to use template engines to create HTML views

# To pull everything together
A simple blog site using Node, Express, and MongoDB will be created, where all current blogs can be listed, a blog can be clicked on for more information, new blogs can be created, and existing blogs can be deleted.
